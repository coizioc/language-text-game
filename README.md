# language-text-game

This is a simple game in which you guess what the language the text presented is written in. This is currently an early proof-of-concept from which I can add more functionality/difficulty as needed. The game can be found [here](https://coizioc.github.io/language-text-game/).

**Todo (in no particular order)**:
* Fix light/dark mode.
* Make answer options "smarter" by grouping together more similar languages.
* Add high scores for different difficulty levels.
