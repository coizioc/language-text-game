# language-text-game

This is a simple game in which you guess what the language the text presented is written in. This is currently an early proof-of-concept from which I can add more functionality/difficulty as needed.

**Todo (in no particular order)**:
* Save high scores between sessions.
* Fix light/dark mode.
* Add support for all Wikipedia languages.
* Make answer options "smarter" by grouping together more similar languages.
* Add difficulty.
* Ensure that the text generated is of a certain length.
